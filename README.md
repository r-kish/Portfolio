# [![R](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=r)](https://skillicons.dev)  R

| Project Link | Area | Tools & Packages | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ‚ìÇÔ∏è [Twitter / Transit Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/r-kish/Tweet-Sentiment-Transit-Analysis/tree/main) | Big data, sentiment analysis | RStudio (tidyverse, ggplot), Tableau | My data research, which was [published into a 36+ page peer-reviewed paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/23/16183), encapsulates the sentiment analysis of hundreds of thousands of tweets from customers of MTA (New York) and statistical data analysis of public transit performance across various MTA and New Jersey Transit agencies, looking at data from before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research topics include valence of the sentiment customers expressed in their tweets, which transit lines perform better/recieve greater sentiment, top concerns/expectations of customers, and more. |
| üòÉ [Sentiment Analysis Demo](https://github.com/r-kish/Tweet-Sentiment-Transit-Analysis/tree/main/Sentiment_Analysis_Demo) | Sentiment analysis, data cleaning | RStudio (tidyverse, ggplot), Tableau | This sentiment analysis demonstration takes a look at the methods used in my Twitter / Transit Sentiment Analysis project by exploring Jane Austen's bibliography of works. Topics covered include tokenization and lemmatization of text, using tidyverse to clean and organize data, and conducting sentiment analysis on transformed data to reveal useful insights. |
| üèÄ [NBA Prediction Models and Analysis](https://github.com/r-kish/NBA-Prediction-Model/tree/main) | Prediction modeling, data analysis, cleaning | RStudio (tidyverse, ggplot) | These prediction models began as a data analysis exercise exploring the career outcomes of NBA players throughout history using data derived from [NBA Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats). The first, in-progress model aims to predict career outcomes of players who have not been in the NBA long enough to define their career outcome using their current season outcomes. The second model predicts rebound success percentages for teams based on their previous rebound success rate throughout the season. Additional analysis explores average points scored per game by All-NBA + All-Star players, the average time it takes for a player to go All-NBA/All-Star, as well as career outcomes for veteran players. |
| üåä [USGS Water Data Prediction Model and Analysis](https://github.com/r-kish/USGS-Water-Data-Analysis) | Prediction modeling, data analysis, cleaning | RStudio (dataRetrieval, ggplot) | During my civil engineering studies, I used R to explore and analyze the behaviors of the Tuscolameta Creek and Delaware River using historical data retrieved from [USGS Water Data](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis). I explore and provide an analysis for the average discharge (flow rate) of both bodies of water, as well as a prediction model to determine flow discharge based on water height using logarithmic/linear regression analysis results for the Tuscolameta Creek. |
| üí∏ [Mega Millions! Analysis](https://github.com/r-kish/Mega-Millions-Analysis) | Data analysis, cleaning | RStudio | I analyzed public data accessible through the [Mega Millions website](https://www.megamillions.com/Winning-Numbers/Previous-Drawings.aspx&ved=2ahUKEwiE96q3sNaFAxW738kDHdFQB7EQ0gIoAHoECCsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1ONlc9nQLr9n5L-x7w_llT), and compared it with theoretical data calculated from the conditions of the game. Additionally, I answer questions regarding ticket revenue vs. payout, lottery jackpot vs. ticket sales, and determine the profitability of the Megaball multiplier. |

| Project Link | Area | Tools & Packages | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üìà [Cryptocurrency API Automation](https://github.com/r-kish/Crypto-API-Automation) | Data analysis, ETL, automation | Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn | Automated real-time extraction of cryptocurrency data from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com). I analyzed 20 cryptocurrencies to find how their value changed over a series of time intervals to find which ones were growing, and which ones shrinking. I also individually analyzed Bitcoin and Ethereum to see how their values fluctuated over the course of 10 minutes. |

| Project Link | Project Description | Dashboard Link |
|---|---|---|
| üìä [e-Commerce Sales Report](https://github.com/r-kish/eCommerce-Sales-Dashboard) | As the co-founder of an online business, I extracted monthly and yearly sales reports from eBay, Poshmark, and Mercari to conduct marketing data analysis in order to provide the owner with insights on online sales and customers' behaviors. Data cleaning and transformation was done in SQL, while visualizations were built in Tableau and compiled into an interactive dashboard. | [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/richard.kish/viz/2023eCommerceSalesDashboard/Dashboard1) |
| ü¶† [COVID-19 Analysis](https://github.com/r-kish/COVID19-Analysis) | Using data derived from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), I extracted data from 2020-2023, and cleaned it using SQL. Furthermore, I made several SQL queries to obtain specific dataframes that were to be visualized. After making these visualizations in Tableau, I pieced them all together into an interactive dashboard. | [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/richard.kish/viz/SQLCovidDashboard_17107162902290/Dashboard1) |
| üè° [Nashville Metropolitan Housing Data Cleaning](https://github.com/r-kish/SQL-Cleaning) | I utilized SQL to clean and organize public data detailing housing in the Nashville, TN metropolitan area. Missing information is filled in when possible, duplicates removed via CTE, and the addresses for each property were separated into state, city, and street address. | SQL Only - no dashboard |
