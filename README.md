| Project Link | Area | Tools & Packages | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ‚ìÇÔ∏è [Twitter / Transit Sentiment Analysis Pre/Post COVID](https://github.com/r-kish/Tweet-Sentiment-Transit-Analysis/tree/main) | Areas | RStudio (tidyverse, ), Tableau | My data research, which was [published into a 36+ page research paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/23/16183), surrounds the sentiment analysis of hundreds of thousands of tweets from customers of MTA (New York), and statistical data analysis of public transit performance across various MTA and New Jersey Transit agencies. Additionally, the study is conducted longitudinally, looking at data from before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Do customers feel postively or negatively about their experience on mass transit? Which transit lines recieve better feedback than others? Does transit performance correlate to customer sentiment? What are the top concerns and expectations of customers? |
| üòÉ [Sentiment Analysis Demo](https://github.com/r-kish/Tweet-Sentiment-Transit-Analysis/tree/main/Sentiment_Analysis_Demo) | Sentiment analysis, data cleaning | RStudio (tidyverse, ), Tableau | This sentiment analysis demonstration takes a look at the methods used in my Twitter / Transit Sentiment Analysis project by exploring Jane Austen's bibliography of works. Topics covered include tokenization and lemmatization of text, using tidyverse to clean and organize data, and conducting sentiment analysis on transformed data to reveal useful insights. |
| üåä [USGS Water Data Analysis](https://github.com/r-kish/USGS-Water-Data-Analysis) | Data analysis, cleaning | RStudio | During my civil engineering studies, I used R to explore and analyze the behaviors of the Tuscolameta Creek and Delaware River using historical data retrieved from [USGS Water Data](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis). I explore and provide an analysis for the average discharge (flow rate) of both bodies of water, as well as a linear regression analysis based on discharge vs. water height for the Tuscolameta Creek. |
