| ‚ìÇÔ∏è [Twitter / Transit Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/r-kish/Tweet-Sentiment-Transit-Analysis/tree/main) | Big data, sentiment analysis | RStudio (tidyverse, ggplot), Tableau | My data research, which was [published into a 36+ page research paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/23/16183), surrounds the sentiment analysis of hundreds of thousands of tweets from customers of MTA (New York) and statistical data analysis of public transit performance across various MTA and New Jersey Transit agencies, looking at data from before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research topics include valence of the sentiment customers expressed in their tweets, which transit lines perform better/recieve greater sentiment, top concerns/expectations of customers, and more. |
| üòÉ [Sentiment Analysis Demo](https://github.com/r-kish/Tweet-Sentiment-Transit-Analysis/tree/main/Sentiment_Analysis_Demo) | Sentiment analysis, data cleaning | RStudio (tidyverse, ggplot), Tableau | This sentiment analysis demonstration takes a look at the methods used in my Twitter / Transit Sentiment Analysis project by exploring Jane Austen's bibliography of works. Topics covered include tokenization and lemmatization of text, using tidyverse to clean and organize data, and conducting sentiment analysis on transformed data to reveal useful insights. |
| üåä [USGS Water Data Analysis](https://github.com/r-kish/USGS-Water-Data-Analysis) | Data analysis, cleaning | RStudio (dataRetrieval, ggplot) | During my civil engineering studies, I used R to explore and analyze the behaviors of the Tuscolameta Creek and Delaware River using historical data retrieved from [USGS Water Data](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis). I explore and provide an analysis for the average discharge (flow rate) of both bodies of water, as well as a linear regression analysis based on discharge vs. water height for the Tuscolameta Creek. |

| üìä [e-Commerce Sales Report](https://github.com/r-kish/eCommerce-Sales-Dashboard) | An online shop owner allowed me to use their yearly sales reports from eBay, Poshmark, and Mercari to conduct data analysis in order to give them insights on their online sales and their customers' behaviors. Visualizations were built in Tableau and compiled into an interactive dashboard. | [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/richard.kish/viz/2023eCommerceSalesDashboard/Dashboard1) |
| ü¶† [COVID-19 Analysis](https://github.com/r-kish/COVID19-Analysis) | Using data derived from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), I extracted data from 2020-2023, and cleaned it using SQL. Furthermore, I made several SQL queries to obtain specific dataframes that were to be visualized. After making these visualizations in Tableau, I pieced them all together into an interactive dashboard. | [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/richard.kish/viz/SQLCovidDashboard_17107162902290/Dashboard1) |
| üè° [Nashville Metropolitan Housing Data Cleaning](https://github.com/r-kish/SQL-Cleaning) | I utilized SQL to clean and organize public data detailing housing in the Nashville, TN metropolitan area. Missing information is filled in when possible, duplicates removed via CTE, and the addresses for each property were separated into state, city, and street address. | SQL Only - no dashboard |
